# Mapping_Earthquakes Challenge 
BootCamp  Week 13. GeoJSON, Javascript

# Overview
This Challenge is  about mapping earthquakes data from diferent sources, using  D3 library, Leaflet library, MapBox API and JavaScript. 
The project allows switch between 3 different types of maps: Street, Satellite and Navigation Night, also showing the record of earthquakes in the last 7 days, identifying them as follows:
  1. With a circle of size and color proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake, as well as a pop-up with its magnitude and location. 
  2. A map of the tectonic layers around the world, which allows us to identify the ones that have registered the most seismic activity.
  3. Finally, the incidents with magnitud greater tha 4.5 Richter scale, classified as major earthquakes, reserving the red color for earthquakes which magnitud greater      than 6.
